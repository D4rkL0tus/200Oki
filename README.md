<h3>Introduction/Purpose</h3>
<p>
  200Oki is a tool used for getting status codes on a normally a large ammount of subdomains or websites.
  This tool was created in use for scanning in large portions of sites. With bounty hunters espiecially in mind.
  This has been an idea of mine for quite sometime now, I have wanted to be able to get status codes or at least understand
  if a website can be accessed or not without having to go through copy and paste the subdomain into my browser (or using curl, invoke-webrequest, etc).
  It was giving me an absolute headache doing that.
